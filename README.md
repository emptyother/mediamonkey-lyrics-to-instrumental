A Mediamonkey addon that adds a button to the toolbar. When you click this button, lyrics are changed to "Instrumental" for selected songs.

To create a *.mmip file (a mediamonkey plugin file), run `npm i` then `npm run build`. This creates the file in the `./dist` folder.
For installing this in mediamonkey double-click the new *.mmip file and follow Mediamonkey's installation. The button and script
should be visible immediatly after installation, no restart needed.
